# Explore-US-Bikeshare
Python project crafted for the Udacity Nanodegree program in Programming for Data Science using Python

## Overview
For this project, I used Python to study data about bike sharing in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to bring in the data and figure out useful information by doing some math. 
Also, I made a program that lets people type things in the computer to see interesting facts about the data.

## Files Required
 washington.csv || new_york_city.csv || chicago.csv

## Programming Language and code environment 
Python and depends on the following libraries: 1- pandas 2- numpy and Jupyter notebook.
